# James McKenzie's React Portfolio

This serves as a replacement to my previously made [Vue Portfolio](https://github.com/lunarised/vue-portfolio), as the Vue-Modal library was never updated to work on Vue 3, and in general I thought the site could do with a bit of a revamp

When live, the site can be found at [https://james-mckenzie.tech](https://james-mckenzie.tech) which is being hosted through Vercel.

Feel free to report any bugs in the issue tracker, and I should fix them up as soon as I can
